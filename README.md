Delivery App Clone with React Native and Expo
This project is a clone of a popular delivery app, built using React Native and Expo. It aims to replicate core functionalities of the original app, focusing on delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience on both iOS and Android platforms. By leveraging the power of React Native for cross-platform development and Expo for rapid development and testing, this clone serves as a robust template for building high-performance delivery applications.

Features

TailwindCSS Integration: Utilizes Native Wind (TailwindCSS for React Native) for elegant and responsive styling.
Sanity.io Backend: Employs Sanity as a backend service for managing and querying data, ensuring real-time updates and scalable data storage.
