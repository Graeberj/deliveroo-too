Delivery App Clone with React Native and Expo
This project is a clone of a popular delivery app, built using React Native and Expo. It aims to replicate core functionalities of the original app, focusing on delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience on both iOS and Android platforms. By leveraging the power of React Native for cross-platform development and Expo for rapid development and testing, this clone serves as a robust template for building high-performance delivery applications.
